I have been trying to replicate the RFID Network with the nRF24L01 modules that Ben Duggan has successfully implemented at Indian University.
I would like to point out that the nRF24L01 2.4 GHz trasnciever modules was chosen because there is a large online forum community to reference.
Ben Duggan was able to successfully use the arduino IDE Network scripts that were created by Tmrh20 (Link: https://tmrh20.github.io/RF24) and implement it onto the ETAG Reader and the GEN2.
In additiona, Ben was working on creating a RFIDNetwork User Manual for others to implement as well. However, he is currently making changes to it on his private github reprository (Link: https://github.com/BenSDuggan/RFID-Network-Build).
Lastly, I have created a document that would allow users to understand the general overview of how the RFID Network works and listed some troubleshooting suggestions for future users.
